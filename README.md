This repository contains the code for exporting a large area to a single GeoTIFF, ready to be analysed by a machine-learning model
Steps to apply the Model:

Create a new dataset by using Export_training_data.ipynb - you can use a GeoJSON database as a foundation (many different topics covered!).
Get the Prithvi model from Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-100M) and run the model!
Fine-tune the dataset and run the Workflow (Single point for observation of a static area and the general workflow for any size!)
Run interference and discover new insights!
